It is important to secure and protect our data. This is done using SUPERSECURE passwords.
Lucky for us, we have gotten hold of a great password list. The policy is as following:

1. Always use passwords from our password list, "rockyou.txt", you can find it online.
2. Do not alter the password from the list.
3. Never change your password.
4. The shorter the better, so you remember them.
5. Always add the flag format surrounding your password.
6. When you need to change your password, fill in the password reset form in the lobby of the building.
